# Smart Metering Systems

### About:
Web application for Smart Metering Systems UK, which serves as an interactive map showing the location and information of installed smart meters that monitor household energy consumption.

### Application Features:
- **Authentication page:** ensuring data security begins with user authentication. Our
application provides a secure login system to grant access to authorized personnel.
- **Interactive map:** the heart of our application is the interactive map of the UK, divided
by postcode areas. Each area is colour-coded based on the percentage of commissioned
smart meters or area uptake.
- **Detailed insights:** clicking on a postcode area reveals a wealth of information on the
right sidebar, such as the area's name, the number of energy point identifiers (MPxNs),
and cards with data on all MPxNs in that area.
- **Household information:** further interactions allow users to view individual households
with smart meters, providing information such as device type, ID,
commissioned/firmware status, and firmware status.
- **Dashboard:** application includes a dashboard that offers SMS vital statistics,
including the total number of smart meters, uncommissioned meters, areas with the
lowest uptake, and gauge percentage diagrams.
- **Table view:** for those who prefer structured data, the table page presents paginated
smart meter information.
- **Admin panel:** an authenticated admin user has access to an admin panel for managing
users and credentials.
